## Overview
This project uses a CNN to classify images of dogs and cats. CNNs are especially effective for image recognition tasks, as they automatically detect features and patterns in images that are crucial for classification. The CNN model in this project is trained on a dataset of labeled images of dogs and cats. It achieves a high accuracy rate through multiple layers of convolution, pooling, and dense layers.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of 10,000 labeled images, with 5,000 images each of dogs and cats. These images serve as input to the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The goal of the model is to process each input image and accurately classify whether the image depicts a dog or a cat. The output is a binary classification, where the model predicts one of two categories: dog or cat. This allows the system to automatically recognize the type of animal in new, unseen images based on the features it learned during training.
